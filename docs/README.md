# rnli-smeac
A simple HTML + JS dashboard for RNLI SMEAC Briefings 

"Situation Mission Execution Administration and Command" ("SMEAC") Briefings are now being used across the RNLI. 

This project aims to display the nessessary information required by lifeboat crews for an effective SMEAC briefing during training or emergency launch. 

The dashboard is setup for North Berwick Lifeboat Station (my station), but can easily be modified to other stations. It is effectively a collection of Iframes :).

The whole thing took about 30 mins to make, and initially is acting as a prototype. If needed a fancier version can always be built.
